Second, it is possible that parts of one object intersect other parts of the same object, the so-called self-collisions. In this chapter, we present several new algorithms that detect collisions between deformable objects more efficiently than previous approaches. For instance, we prove that our new kinetic AABB-Tree is optimal in the number of updates that is required to restore a bounding volume hierarchy after deformations. Moreover, our kinetic Separation-List can perform both, continuous collision and self-collision queries at interactive rates.

	abstract = {In the past few years, many efficient rendering and surface reconstruction algorithms for point clouds have been developed. However, collision detection of point clouds has not been considered until now, although this is a prerequisite to use them for interactive or animated 3D graphics. We present a novel approach for time-critical collision detection of point clouds. Based solely on the point representation, it can detect intersections of the underlying implicit surfaces. The surfaces do not need to be closed. We construct a point hierarchy where each node stores a sufficient sample of the points plus a sphere covering of a part of the surface. These are used to derive criteria that guide our hierarchy traversal so as to increase convergence. One of them can be used to prune pairs of nodes, the other one is used to prioritize still to be visited pairs of nodes. At the leaves we efficiently determine an intersection by estimating the smallest distance. We have tested our implementation for several large point cloud models. The results show that a very fast and precise answer to collision detection queries can always be given.

	abstract = {Based on the potential of current programmable GPUs, recently several approaches were developed that use the GPU to calculate deformations of surfaces like the folding of cloth or to convert higher level geometry to renderable primitives like NURBS or subdivision surfaces. These algorithms are realized as a per-frame operation and take advantage of the parallel processing power of the GPU. Unfortunately, an efficient accurate collision detection, that is necessary for the simulation itself or for the interaction with and editing of the objects, can currently not be integrated seamlessly into these GPU-based approaches without switching back to the CPU. In this paper we describe a novel GPU-based collision detection method for deformable parameterized surfaces that can easily be combined with the aforementioned approaches. Representing the individual parameterized surfaces by stenciled geometry images allows to generate GPU-optimized bounding volume hierarchies in real-time that serve as a basis for an optimized GPU-based hierarchical collision detection algorithm. As a test case we applied our algorithm to the collision detection of deformable trimmed NURBS models, which is an important problem in industry. For the trimming and tessellation of the NURBS on the GPU we used a recent approach [GBK05] and combined it with our collision detection algorithm. This way we are able to render and check collisions for deformable models consisting of several thousands of trimmed NURBS patches in real-time.

We also describe efficient algorithms to compute a linear bounding volume hierarchy (LBVH) and update them using refitting methods. Moreover, we show that tight-fitting bounding volume hierarchies offer improved performance on GPU-like throughput architectures. We use our algorithms to perform discrete and continuous collision detection including self-collisions, as well as separation distance computation between non-overlapping models. In practice, our approach (gProximity) can perform these queries in a few milliseconds on a PC with NVIDIA GTX 285 card on models composed of tens or hundreds of thousands of triangles used in cloth simulation, surgical simulation, virtual prototyping and N-body simulation.

Using graphics hardware to densely sample the distance field of the rigid object over the arbitrary mesh, we compute minimal proximity and collision response information on the graphics processing unit (GPU) using blending and depth buffering, as well as parallel reduction techniques, thus minimizing the readback bottleneck. Although limited to image-space resolution, our algorithm provides high and steady performance when compared with other similar algorithms.

	abstract = {In real time computer graphics, “interactivity” is limited to a display rate of 30 frames per second. However, in multimodal virtual environments involving haptic interactions, a much higher update rate of about 1 kHz is necessary to ensure continuous interactions and smooth transitions. The simplest and most efficient interaction paradigm in such environments is to represent the haptic cursor as a point. However, in many situations, such as those in the development of real time medical simulations involving the interactions of long slender surgical tools with soft deformable organs, such a paradigm is nonrealistic and at least a line-based interaction is desirable. While such paradigms exist, the main impediment to their widespread use is the associated computational complexity. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an efficient algorithm for computing the interaction of a line-shaped haptic cursor and polygonal surface models which has a near constant complexity. The algorithm relies on space-time coherence, topological information, and the properties of lines in 3D space to maintain proximity information between a line segment and triangle meshes. For interaction with convex objects, the line is represented by its end points and a dynamic point, which is the closest point on the line to any potentially colliding triangle. To deal with multiple contacts and non-convexities, the line is decomposed into segments and a dynamic point is used for each segment. The algorithm may be used to compute collision detection and response with rigid as well as deformable objects with no performance penalty. Realistic examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Previous state-of-the-art BVH-based collision detection approaches exploited the spatio-temporal coherence of simulations by maintaining a bounding volume test tree (BVTT) front. A major drawback of these algorithms is that large deformations in the scenes decrease culling efficiency and slow down collision queries. Moreover, for front-based methods, the inefficient caching on GPU caused by the arbitrary layout of BVH and BVTT front nodes becomes a critical performance issue. We present a fast and robust BVH-based collision detection scheme on GPU that addresses the above problems by ordering and restructuring BVHs and BVTT fronts. Our techniques are based on the use of histogram sort and an auxiliary structure BVTT front log, through which we analyze the dynamic status of BVTT front and BVH quality. Our approach efficiently handles inter- and intra-object collisions and performs especially well in simulations where there is considerable spatio-temporal coherence. The benchmark results demonstrate that our approach is significantly faster than the previous BVH-based method, and also outperforms other state-of-the-art spatial subdivision schemes in terms of speed.},

Compared to traditional BVH-based methods, MAT can provide a high-fidelity volumetric approximation of 3D complex objects, resulting in higher collision culling efficiency. However, due to MAT’s non-hierarchical structure, it may be outperformed in collision-light scenarios because several cullings at the top level of a BVH may take a large number of cullings with MAT. We propose a collision detection method that combines MAT and BVH to address the above problem. Our technique efficiently culls collisions between dynamic and static objects.

Although this geometric operation is relatively simple, in practice, we have to evaluate billions of such operations as the scene consists of millions of primitives, and the image synthesis algorithms require a high number of samples to provide a plausible result. Thus, scene primitives are commonly arranged in spatial data structures to accelerate the search. In the last two decades, the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) has become the de facto standard acceleration data structure for ray tracing-based rendering algorithms in offline and recently also in real-time applications. In this report, we review the basic principles of bounding volume hierarchies as well as advanced state of the art methods with a focus on the construction and traversal. Furthermore, we discuss industrial frameworks, specialized hardware architectures, other applications of bounding volume hierarchies, best practices, and related open problems.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous BVH traversal, as a dynamic task of pair-wise proximity tests, poses several challenges in terms of parallelization using GPUs. It is a highly dynamic and data-dependent problem which can induce control-flow divergence and inefficient data-access patterns. We present a simple solution using the bulk-synchronous parallel model to ensure a uniform mode of execution, and balanced workloads across GPU threads. The method is easy to implement, fast and operates entirely on the GPU by relying on a topology-centred work expansion scheme to ensure large concurrent workloads. We demonstrate speedups of upto 7.1x over the widely used "streams" model for GPU based parallel collision detection.},

Firstly, the advantages and feasibility of using hierarchical bounding box for collision detection in cloth simulation are analyzed theoretically; Then AABB bounding box and the sphere bounding box is selected, and a group of BVH structure bounding boxes is constructed in parallel by using the hierarchical bounding box generation method based on Morton code; Finally, the computational shader is used to execute in parallel so that multiple particles update their positions at the same time and traverse the BVH structure of the model. The experimental results shown in Unity show that this method reduces the tedious work of manually defining the bounding box, speeds up the collision detection rate, accurately depicts the state when the cloth collides with the object and is suitable for real-time interactive applications.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses traversal through binary space-partitioning (BSP) trees. BSP trees are data structures that allow for fast visible-surface determination in environments where the viewer moves while the polygonal objects remain static, as in interactive walkthroughs. One solution to the visible-surface problem is to render a scene's polygons in back-to-front order so that polygons nearer to the viewer overwrite those farther away. However, this simple painter's algorithm offers no consistent means of identifying polygon depth; choosing either the extreme vertices or the centroid as the sorting key fails in certain cases. This algorithm also fails in cases of cyclic overlaps and interpenetrating polygons. The depth sort algorithm solves all of these problems, but in a view-dependent way. This chapter describes the construction of BSP trees and their traversal, which generates polygons in a sorted order suitable for rendering. It also presents an efficient viewer/object collision detection algorithm based upon this versatile data structure.},

In particular, this algorithm constructs a linear quadtree from a raster image stored on disk in time proportional to the number of nodes in the output quadtree plus the (relatively minor) amount of time to read the input data. Empirical tests show that for typical 512 × 512 pixel images, the new algorithm results in an order of magnitude or better improvement over traditional algorithms which insert each pixel separately and require a merge routine to form larger nodes. These traditional algorithms have an execution time that is proportional to the number of pixels in the image. Thus, when using the number of insertions into the output quadtree as a metric, our algorithm is optimal to within a constant factor. The algorithm is also adapted to build a pointer-based quadtree, again without a need to merge any nodes.},

Each leaf node is represented by use of a locational code corresponding to a sequence of directional codes that locate the leaf along a path from the root of the tree. Somewhat related is the concept of a forest which is a representation that consists of a collection of maximal blocks. It is reviewed and refined to enable the representation of a quadtree as a sequence of approximations. In essence, all BLACK and WHITE nodes are said to be of type GB and GW, respectively. GRAY nodes are of type GB if at least two of their sons are of type GB; otherwise, they are of type GW. Sequences of approximations using various combinations of locational codes of GB and GW nodes are proposed and shown to be superior to approximation methods based on truncation of nodes below a certain level in the tree. These approximations have two important properties. First, they are progressive in the sense that as more of the image is transmitted, the receiving device can construct a better approximation (contrast with facsimile methods which transmit the image one line at a time). Second, they are proved to lead to compression in the sense that they never require more than MIN(B, W) nodes where B and W correspond to the number of BLACK and WHITE nodes in the original quadtree. Algorithms are given for constructing the approximation sequences as well as decoding them to rebuild the original quadtree.},

	abstract = {Discretized distance maps have been used in robotics for path planning and efficient collision detection applications in static environments.1 However, they have been used at the finest level of resolution, thereby making them memory intensive. In this article, we propose an octree-based hierarchical representation for discretized distance maps, called Octree Distance Maps (ODM), and show its use in efficient collision detection. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to consider the use of hierarchical distance maps for collision detection. ODM representation achieves an advantageous compromise between array-based distance maps and ordinary octrees. Compared to the former, ODM requires a fraction of the memory at the expense of somewhat slower collision detection. Compared to the latter, ODM requires slightly more memory but provides a significant improvement in collision detection. ODM is similar to the quadtree distance transforms used in image representation2 but differs significantly in various aspects of distance representation and its use in collision detection since the main motivation behind ODM is efficient collision detection instead of image representation. We then present algorithms for (1) creating an ODM from an octree, and (2) for efficient collision detection based on an ODM. Extensive experiments are then presented and compared with octree-based collision detection. Our experimental results quantify the advantageous compromise achieved by ODM representation. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {In the process of simulating and modeling real objects, the phenomenon of objects penetrating each other may occur in the model, which is unrealistic and then the research of collision detection (CD) is generated. As a bottleneck of virtual environment simulation, researchers have conducted in-depth research on CD, especially the CD of deformable objects. In this paper, we briefly review the related research on CD of deformable objects regarding relevant literature. First, we briefly introduce previous reviews of CD. Second, we review the popular research methods and limitations of CD between deformable objects. Third, we review the popular research methods and limitations of self-collision detection in deformable objects. Finally, we discuss future directions of development. This review can be used as a reference for the application of CD in all directions.},

	isbn = {978-1-315-11933-5},
	abstract = {The Handbook of Data Structures and Applications was first published over a decade ago. This second edition aims to update the first by focusing on areas of research in data structures that have seen significant progress. While the discipline of data structures has not matured as rapidly as other areas of computer science, the book aims to update those areas that have seen advances.

Retaining the seven-part structure of the first edition, the handbook begins with a review of introductory material, followed by a discussion of well-known classes of data structures, Priority Queues, Dictionary Structures, and Multidimensional structures. The editors next analyze miscellaneous data structures, which are well-known structures that elude easy classification. The book then addresses mechanisms and tools that were developed to facilitate the use of data structures in real programs. It concludes with an examination of the applications of data structures. 

Four new chapters have been added on Bloom Filters, Binary Decision Diagrams, Data Structures for Cheminformatics, and Data Structures for Big Data Stores, and updates have been made to other chapters that appeared in the first edition.The Handbook is invaluable for suggesting new ideas for research in data structures, and for revealing application contexts in which they can be deployed. Practitioners devising algorithms will gain insight into organizing data, allowing them to solve algorithmic problems more efficiently.},
